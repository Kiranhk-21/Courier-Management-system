# Courier-Management-system

This is a Database management System used to track orders given by customers. I have used streamlit for front-end.
I have made use of procedures and triggers for checking if valid data is to be entered or already entered.

Below diagram is the Entity Relationship diagram for the same.

My project contains About page and also allows you to perform basic CRUD operations on the select tables. This can be extented to all the other tables with more trigger checks and procedure calls.

I have also given some of the queries in join.sql which contains join operations.
